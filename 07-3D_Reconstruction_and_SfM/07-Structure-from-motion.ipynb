    "# 3D Reconstruction and Structure from Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are given a series of images from a disaster situation. How can we begin to make sense of the contents of the image? Typically this involves answering two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _What_ is in an image (e.g. debris, buildings, etc.)?\n",
    "- _Where_ are these things located _in 3D space_ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are first going to set the first question aside and focus entirely on the second. This will be the first in two lectures on so called \"structure from motion\", which is the idea that you can recreate a 3D scene from a series of 2D images by taking those images from a moving camera. Today's lecture will focus on the theory of 3D reconstruction and how to implement it. Tomorrow's lecture will focus on a real world example of structure from motion, and we will work to assign GPS coordinates to pixels on an image. \n",

    "## The Camera Model: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first introduce the model that we will be basing our analysis on. For this session, we will be using the _pinhole model_ of a camera, depicted in the following picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/pinhole.png\" width=\"300\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model of the camera, light rays are reflected off of an object (in this case a kettle), they pass through an infinitesimally small pinhole, and arrive at the opposite wall of the camera, creating a photo-negative (think upside down) image of the object. The pinhole is located at a point called the _center of projection_. Because the image on the actual camera is a photo-negative, we typically instead center our reference frame on the center of projection and work as if the image were on the opposite side, which we will call the _image plane_. The distance _f_ between the center of projection and the image plane is called the _focal length_ which is usually measured in millimeters. On the image plane, the center of the plane is called the _principal point_ and the line that connects the center of projection and the principal point is called the _principal axis_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can align our coordinate frame as follows: let's center our coordinate system such that the origin is the center of projection, let's align the Z-axis such that it passes through principal axis, and let's align the X- and Y-axis such that the X-axis goes along the horizonal direction of the image plane and the Y-axis goes along the vertical direction of the image plane. Note that X increases to the right, but Y increases *downward*. This is shown in the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/reference_frame.png\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "The image plane is given by a _uv-plane_ that is centered on the principal point and is orthogonal to the principal axis. Note that cameras typically measure coordinates starting from the upper-left corner, and increasing to the left and downwards (which motivates our decision to align our Y axis downwards). Furthermore, note that cameras cannot capture an image with perfect precision. Rather, they are composed of small elements called _pixels_ that vary in intensity in order to capture the scene. Therefore, we would rather operate on the discrete pixel plane, which we will call the lowercase xy-plane. You can compare both planes in the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/xy_plane.png\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects create a projection on the xy-plane, which is what we actually see on the image. For example, the point $M$ on the kettle is projected onto the xy-plane on the point _m_. Suppose we have the coordinates ($X$, $Y$, $Z$) of the point $M$. **What are the coordinates on the xy-plane of the point $m$?** State your answer in terms of $\\alpha$ (the focal length measured in pixels, not millimeters), $p_x$ and $p_y$ (the coordinates of the principal point $p$ in the xy-plane), and $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, the coordinates of the point $M$.\n",

Therefore, $\\frac{x-p_x}{\\alpha} = \\frac{X}{Z}$ and $\\frac{y-p_y}{\\alpha} = \\frac{Y}{Z}$. Now it's a matter of solving: $x = \\alpha\\frac{X}{Z} + p_x$ and $y = \\alpha\\frac{Y}{Z} + p_y$\n",

    "\n",
    "Scene reconstruction requires us to go the other way around: we know the coordinates ($x$, $y$) of $m$ and we want the ($X$, $Y$, $Z$) coordinates of the point $M$. This presents a problem: we have two equations and three unknowns. Specifically, there is an ambiguity in the depth $Z$ that is impossible to resolve with just one image. Therefore, the point $M$ can be anywhere along the ray connecting the center of projection and the point $m$. This is shown in the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/ambiguity.png\" width=\"150\"  />\n",

    "It might seem tempting to take the focal length as is, and to take the height and width of the image, divide by two and call that the coordinates of the principal point. While this might certainly be a start if you have no other options, there are some limitations to take into account. First, recall that the focal length here is measured in millimeters, but we need the length in pixels $\\alpha = m*f$, where $m$ is the size in millimeters of each pixel. This information is rarely found in the metadata. Usually, if you want to get the focal length in pixels just from the metadata, you would have to find the camera specifications online and make the conversion of millimeters to pixels. Also, the focal length is typically rounded to the nearest integer in the metadata, further complicating matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, because of manufacturing constraints in positioning the sensor the principal point is always off from the middle of an image by a few pixels. While the middle of an image is most likely a good approximation, the error will continue to add up as you go farther away from the camera center. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, even if you have the focal length and principal point coordinates, the reconstruction must account for _distortion_. Distortion typically comes from imperfect lenses. The most well known form of distortion is _radial distortion_. This has the effect of making straight lines bulge outwards the farther away you are from the center. The figure below shows an example of this: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/distortion.jpg\" width=\"300\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "Distortion is rarely in the image metadata. Sometimes cameras have distortion control that corrects for distortion when it's taking the image, so you don't have to worry about it. Still, this is relatively rare and it does not show up in the metadata whether distortion control was applied. So if you're not familiar with the camera you're using, you're still in the dark.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get around this is to perform explicit camera calibration. A common way to do this is to map points with a known 3D-to-2D correspondence (like a chessboard) and perform an optimization to correct for the distortion. How this typically works is by assigning coordinates to the inner corners of the camera (e.g. the top left corner will be (0, 0, 0), the one on the right might be (1, 0, 0), the one below would be (0, 1, 0)), and then choosing the focal length, principal point and distortion parameters that best explain deviations in the expected 2D coordinates. Typically you have to take something on the order of 20-30 images of a chessboard from slightly varying locations for this procedure to work."

This is a more general notation, and it takes into account the possibility that cameras might not have square pixels. If one side of a pixel is larger than the other, it makes more sense to talk about focal length measured in pixel width or height. Still, cameras typically have square pixels, and this is reflected in the fact that $\\alpha_x$ is very close to $\\alpha_y$, so we can chalk up the discrepancy to measurement error.\n",

    "We now need to find the rotation and translation $R$ and $t$ of both cameras. To reiterate, $t$ is a 3x1 vector that denotes the distance from the origin in $X$, $Y$ and $Z$\\*. $R$ is a 3x3 matrix that encodes the rotation of the camera. We made our lives a bit easier by centering the coordinate system on the first camera, such that $t_1 = [0, 0, 0]'$ and $R_1$ is the identity matrix. Remember that we also aligned the coordinate system such that the vector $[0, 0, 1]'$ is in the direction that the camera is pointing. One way to interpret the rotation matrix $R_2$ is by saying that it is the matrix that rotates the vector $[0, 0, 1]'$ into the vector that is aligned with the direction of the second camera. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most amazing results in multiview geometry is that $R_2$ and $t_2$ can both be recovered (up to scale, in the case of $t_2$) just by knowing the corresponding points and the intrinsic parameters. At a very high level, this is a key tenet of something called _epipolar geometry_. Consider images (a) and (b) below. On the image you will find random corresponding points between the two images. On image (a), clearly the camera that took (b) is somewhere to the right. Imagine we could extend (a) so much that you could actually see the camera that took (b), and let's draw a line between the camera that took (b) and all of the corresponding points. What you would find is a series of lines, called epipolar lines, that all converge at the camera that took (b), whose point is called the epipole. This is what we see in (c) and (d). \n",

    "\n",
    "It turns out there is a matrix called the _fundamental matrix_ that encodes this information. This matrix can be estimated using the corresponding points we got before. Furthermore, by combining it with the intrinsic parameters, we get another matrix called the _essential matrix_ which can then be decomposed into a relative rotation and translation $R_2$ and $t_2$, which is what we're after! This is of course a criminally high level summary of how this works. For more information, this is an excellent source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzYn0OPO0Yw.\n",

    "\\* This is actually a bit incorrect. $t$ represents the vector connecting the center of projection to the origin *from the point of view of the camera being considered*, not the first camera. Still, the general idea is that it denotes displacement."

    "## Finalizing the reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have everything we need to reconstruct the scene in 3D! We have corresponding points in two images, the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the extrinsic parameters as the camera took the two images. There is just one caveat. Remember that the value $t_2$ that we obtained was up to scale. It turns out that our entire scene is scaled such that the length of $t_2 = 1$. This means that while the relative distances between the reconstructed points are conserved, the absolute positions are not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to take advantage of visualization software that currently exists, we will use a package called OpenSfM (https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM). OpenSfM automatically goes through the trouble of extracting the features, matching them, finding the poses of the cameras and doing the triangulation. One thing it does not do, however, is the camera calibration. We can either provide our own intrinsic camera parameters or we can let the algorithm take its best guess through a process called _bundle adjustment_. Bundle adjustment essentially works by identifying the _reprojection error_ (the error in reprojecting the reconstructed 3D features back onto the image) and slightly modifying the camera positions and parameters, as well as the positions of the features, so that the error is minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, what do we do when we have more than three images? Clearly if you can find the camera pose of image 2 relative to image 1, then it's possible to find the pose of image 3 relative to image 2. Therefore, multiple images can take part in a reconstruction. Here, bundle adjustment is very important to ensure that errors in the reconstruction do not keep adding up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps to reconstruct a scene:\n",
    "- Extract the focal length from the metadata\n",
    "- Detect features from images (in this particular case, we are using so called HAHOG features)\n",
    "- Match features across images\n",
    "- Reconstruct the scene using the inferred rotations and translations\n",
    "- Visualize the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSfM has a very good command line interface, so we'll move to the terminal for this portion. However, the commands are on the following cell in case you want to refer back to them."

From the kitchen_example/ directory, copy \"config.yaml\" and paste it in workspace/. Take two or more images of your work space and upload them to workspace/images.
