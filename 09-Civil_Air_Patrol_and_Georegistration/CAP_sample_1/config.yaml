# OpenSfM will use the default parameters from opensfm/config.py
# Set here any parameter that you want to override for this dataset
# For example:
depthmap_min_consistent_views: 2      # Min number of views that should reconstruct a point for it to be valid
depthmap_save_debug_files: yes        # Save debug files with partial reconstruction results
feature_process_size: 1024

matching_gps_distance: 300            # Maximum gps distance between two images for matching
matching_gps_neighbors: 2             # Number of images to match selected by GPS distance. Set to 0 to use no limit (or disable if matching_gps_distance is also 0)
matching_time_neighbors: 2            # Number of images to match selected by time taken. Set to 0 to disable
use_altitude_tag: yes                 # Use or ignore EXIF altitude tag
align_method: orientation_prior       # orientation_prior or naive
align_orientation_prior: horizontal   # horizontal, vertical or no_roll UPDATED: added plane_based
bundle_use_gps: yes                   # Enforce GPS position in bundle adjustment
