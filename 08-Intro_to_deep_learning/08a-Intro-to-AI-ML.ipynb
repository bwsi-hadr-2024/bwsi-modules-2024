    "# Intro to Machine Learning\n",
    "We're going to be working with CAP imagery for the second half of this week. Recall the two main guiding questions for this week:\n",
    "- _What_ is in an image (e.g. debris, buildings, etc.)?\n",
    "- _Where_ are these things located _in 3D space_ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen how structure from motion can begin to answer the second of those questions, at least in a coarse manner. The first question is more difficult than the second for one crucial reason: it (so far) can not be answered *solely* using image data. Recall that structure from motion was able to leverage image metadata, features and geometric constraints without having to insert any \"outside\" data. When detecting the components of an image, there is a certain amount of subjectivity that so far requires human input. For example, if you want to detect flooding in an image, there need to be some set of rules that the software can determine \"if (rules are satisfied), then (flooding = True)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you start to tackle this problem? We're going to make the problem a bit simpler by turning it into a classification problem rather than a localization problem. That is, instead of finding where flooding is in an image, we'll find whether there is flooding at all. With that in mind, let's first try a naive approach and see if we can simply enumerate the rules. Let's look at some flooding images:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/010_1282_99809b0c-fc64-46e5-957f-7ff8e7547d8c.jpg\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/DSC_0655_0cbbe7e5-be24-4274-bf5a-664c6f2dc3e1.jpg\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we see? It looks like flooding is this murky, brown color that covers most of the image. So let's make a rule: if some percentage of the image is this brownish color (you can think of detecting this by creating some sort of index, like you did with the satellite imagery), there is flooding in the image. This might work for the two images we saw, but the real test is seeing if it works with other images. So let's look at another one:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/DSC_8218_7bb15c80-481b-411a-a54a-a36e9d8b6098.jpg\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "This image has a large percentage of it covered by brownish looking water. However, it's clearly not flooding, but rather just a lake. No problem, let's just make another rule: if some percentage of the image is this brownish color *and* there are also lots of buildings (let's also make an index for that), there is flooding in the image. Let's see if this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/DSC_8192_fe6812cd-c985-4e59-a62c-04a883ec42cc.jpg\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is just some lake (the same lake as before, in fact). At this point, we might be thinking of shifting our strategy a bit. Clearly having someone sit down and enumerate all of the rules is impractical in this case\\*. There is simply too much variability in the images to come up with a set of rules that is remotely generalizable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the major motivations of machine learning. The idea is that, rather than enumerate the rules that determine flooding, we're going to just enumerate the outcomes (e.g. whether there is flooding or not) and develop algorithms for the computer to *learn* what the rules are. There is a rich literature (and a host of undergraduate and graduate courses) on how these algorithms are designed, but on these next couple of days we will instead focus on how to interpret and implement them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\* This isn't to say that enumerating the rules isn't practical in *every* case. It really depends on the characteristics of the data. "

To this end, one of the major paradigms in machine learning is to separate our data into a *training set* and a *testing set*. The training set is a subset of the given data that we will actually provide to the algorithm to learn, while the testing set will be used solely to report the performance on data that the algorithm has not seen.

    "## Deep learning\n",
    "So far, we've worked exclusively with linear decision boundaries. However, usually data is much more complicated (as you should have seen from the exercise). Therefore, we might want to look for something that has higher predictive power. One of the most popular tools in machine learning has been the *neural network*. A neural network is (loosely) inspired by the way neurons are connected and operate. Let's first look at the simplest possible neural network and work our way up:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"notebook_images/nn_nohidden_new.png\" width=\"500\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are made up of *layers*. In the image above, the neural network has two layers. The first layer is called the *input layer*, and the last layer is called the *output layer*. Each layer is composed of *neurons*. In the input layer, each neuron is one of the features from the training data. For example, the first neuron might be the mean radius, and the second neuron might be the mean texture. We're going to refer to each neuron by $x_{l, n}$, where $l$ is the number of the layer and $n$ is the number of the neuron within the layer. Using this notation, mean radius = $x_{1, 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron in the input layer is connected to *every* neuron in the following layer by a *weight*. We will denote each weight by $w_{l, i, o}$, where $l$ is the layer at the tail of the arrow, $i$ is the number of the neuron at the tail of the arrow and $o$ is the number of the neuron at the head of the arrow. In the figure above, the color of the arrow corresponds to the value of the weight (blue means negative, red means positive). Every neuron in subsequent layers is equal to the sum of the products of the neurons and the weight that connects them. In this case, the neuron in the output layer is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x_{2, 1} = x_{1, 1}w_{1, 1, 1} + x_{1, 2}w_{1, 2, 1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the value of the output layer, you can obtain the predicted classification by applying some function to $x_{2, 1}$. An example of such a function would be similar to what we did previously:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_{pred} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "    1               & \\text{if } x_{2, 1}\\geq 0\\\\\n",
    "    0,              & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So training a neural network is simply finding the weights $w$ that minimize the error. If you are keen-eyed though, you might have realized that the example above is identical to what we were doing before. Therefore, we still have not arrived at a more powerful classifier. Let's try a more complicated neural network.\n",

By having a weighted sum of these neurons in the output layer, we are arriving at a function that, by virtue of being a sum of lines is not itself linear. One of the biggest results in machine learning is that, as you increase the number of neurons in the hidden layer, you can approximate *any* function, meaning that you can always make a more powerful classifier by just adding more neurons. However, usually this is not computationally efficient. Rather, most of the time it makes more sense to introduce more hidden layers as opposed to more neurons, as shown in the image below:\n",
